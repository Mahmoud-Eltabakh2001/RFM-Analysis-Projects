# RFM-Analysis-Projects
-This repository contains some data analysis projects that are concerned with analyzing customer behavior in purchasing processes based on mathematical metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business

-RFM Analysis is used to understand and segment customers based on their buying behaviour.

-Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customers:
          > recency (the date they made their last purchase)
          > frequency (how often they make purchases)
          > monetary (the amount spent on purchases)
